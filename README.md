Bike Sales Dashboard
üìÑOverview:
This project involves designing an interactive dashboard in Excel to analyze customer purchasing patterns for bikes. The goal was to derive actionable insights for marketing strategies and understand customer behavior.
üîçBusiness Problem:
Retailers need to identify key customer segments and their preferences to increase bike sales. The analysis answers questions like:
‚Ä¢	Who are the primary buyers (age, gender, income)?
‚Ä¢	How does commute distance impact bike usage?
‚Ä¢	What occupations show higher purchasing rates?
üìäProcess:
1.	Data Preparation:
o	Cleaned and structured raw data to remove inconsistencies.
o	Applied Excel formulas for data transformation.
2.	Analysis:
o	Used Pivot Tables to slice data by demographics, income, and commute distance.
o	Created visualizations to track purchase trends.
3.	Visualization:
o	Designed an interactive dashboard using Pivot Charts, Slicers, and Conditional Formatting.
Key Insights:
   1. Male customers with a higher income tend to purchase more bikes compared to females, indicating that targeted marketing efforts could be focused on higher-income male demographics
 
   2. Middle-aged customers dominate bike purchases. This insight could help bike retailers focus their advertising campaigns on this age group
 
   3. Most bike users commute shorter distances (1-5 miles), suggesting bikes are preferred for short commutes. This could influence retailers to promote bikes as an eco-friendly, cost-effective option for short daily commutes
 
   4. Professional and skilled manual workers show a higher tendency to purchase bikes. Retailers could design special offers or financing plans tailored for these groups
 
   5. The number of bikes purchased decreases as commute distance increases, indicating a potential for retailers to innovate in promoting bikes for longer commutes.
 
Skills Used:
‚Ä¢	Tools: Microsoft Excel
‚Ä¢	Techniques: Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Slicers, Data Visualization, Dashboard Design
Future Enhancements:
‚Ä¢	Integrate external data sources (e.g., weather or location).
‚Ä¢	Automate the dashboard using Excel VBA for real-time updates.
‚Ä¢	Expand to other visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.
